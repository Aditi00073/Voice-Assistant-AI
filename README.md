## Project: Real-Time AI Voice Assistant

**Overview:**  
A web-based AI voice assistant that leverages Python, Google Generative AI, Flask, and JavaScript to deliver seamless, real-time interaction through speech. The system enables users to communicate naturally with the assistant, which understands voice commands, processes inputs on the backend, and provides intelligent responses in real time. Dynamic conversation history is maintained and presented in the web interface for context-aware dialogue and responsive user experiences.

### Key Features

- **Voice-Driven Interaction:**  
  Integrates browser-based speech recognition for capturing user queries and synthesizes AI-generated spoken responses for natural communication.

- **Conversational Intelligence:**  
  Employs Google Generative AI to generate contextually relevant, precise answers, supporting back-and-forth dialogue with dynamic conversation tracking.

- **Live Conversation History:**  
  Dynamically displays both user and assistant exchanges, maintaining a clear record of the ongoing conversation within an intuitive web dashboard.

- **Modern Web Architecture:**  
  Utilizes Flask for backend processing, JavaScript for client-side voice and UI management, and seamless API integration for prompt response times.

- **User Experience:**  
  Offers a responsive and visually appealing interface with real-time updates, supporting fluid, interactive sessions suitable for various personal productivity or educational applications.

### Technologies Used

- Python (Flask framework)
- Google Generative AI API
- JavaScript (Speech recognition and synthesis)
- HTML5, CSS3 (UI/UX design)

This project demonstrates the integration of advanced AI with modern web technologies to create an accessible and interactive user assistant, highlighting practical skills in both backend and frontend development, natural language processing, and real-time system design.
